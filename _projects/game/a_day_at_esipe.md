<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/Lchikar" target="_blank">Louisa Chikar</a> and Margaux SÃ©guy</p>

<p>A day at ESIPE is a Unity 2D game representing the daily life of an ESIPE student (my education at
University). This project allows us to mobilize the creative and computer notions acquired during our
training and to promote the school outside. The game is played with keyboard and mouse and is divided into
five different levels with an introduction and an ending. You can play it <a href="https://lupiote.itch.io/une-journe-lesipe" target="_blank">on itchio</a></p>
