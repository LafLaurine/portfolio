Open 3D Engine (O3DE) is a powerful, open-source 3D engine under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing you to build games, robotic simulations and engaging 3D environments. It was released by Amazon in 2021. The initial version of the engine is an updated version of Amazon Lumberyard.

I began my journey with O3DE to reconnect with C++ and expand my knowledge (and I am also learning Qt thanks to O3DE). The O3DE community is fantastic, and the coding environment is well organized. Many big names in the industry, including Huawei, are involved alongside Amazon. Being part of such an environment offers an incredible opportunity to learn. You can make a lifelong contribution to an AAA-Engine !

For now, I've mostly made contribution to the Lua Editor that is embedded within the O3DE engine but I'm looking to doing more contribution.
