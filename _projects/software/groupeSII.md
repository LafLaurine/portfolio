I am employed by the service company Groupe SII within the Engineering and Consulting division. Groupe SII is active across various sectors, and my current mission contributes to the defense sector.

I have been assigned to a mission at KNDS (Satory, Versailles) since September 2024. In 2015, the companies Nexter and Krauss Maffei Wegmann (KMW), respectively the system integrator of the Leclerc and the Leopard, joined forces to form KNDS to become the European leader in land defense.

My role include enhancing and maintaining software created in C# and WPF. Due to the sensitive nature of the defense sector, I am unable to disclose specific details about my work. Additionally, I have the opportunity to work on a communication software developed in C++.
