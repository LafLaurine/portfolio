Arcane Technologies is developing many solutions in VR, AR, computer vision and 3D interactive application. I was assigned to the team that works on the software
VORTEK Spaces. This software is dedicated to professionals (mostly kitchen designers, interior designers or even architects) to create interactive 3D presentations within minutes.

My goal was to maintain and develop new features to our application by using C#, UWP and Unity. I implemented many elements for the new UI, going from the aesthetic basis of our components using Unity UI (by following the mockup) to implementing scripts to interact with our components and the application. We had to review the entire module management system of our application: when we are on a tab there are these buttons that are displayed, when I click on this button, this panel is displayed with sliders to control an element.
This port brings major technical challenges, which required a lot of thought from my team and I, including a lot of code refactoring. For example, I created tooltips and a UI component that follows 3D objects without overlapping the UI.
As a developer, I ensured the stability of the application by testing it and correcting bugs assigned to me. To catch bugs as early as possible, I wrote unit tests via the Unity Test Framework.

My role, in addition to developing the new UI system, was to follow the tasks that allow us to achieve the finality of the port. To do this, I managed tasks in our ticketing tool, estimating the number of hours a task takes and tracking them in the sprint. I ensured communication between the employees and I had an overall vision of the progress of the project.
