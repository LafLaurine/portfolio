Harfanglab is a cybersecurity scale-up that develops an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software to detect and neutralize modern cyberattacks on corporate desktops and servers. Our algorithms detect abnormal behavior and generate security alerts or block the execution of programs. Our ambition is to protect companies and state administrations against modern IT threats (cybercrime, data theft, influence) that endanger the economic health of companies and the security of the Nation.

My work at HarfangLab is to design, develop and deploy deep and machine learning models using Python.

We also write articles to talk about what we're doing at HarfangLab and how we improve AI in the cybersecurity world : <a href="https://inside.harfanglab.io/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"> inside.harfanglab.io </a>

In this blog I wrote <a href="https://inside.harfanglab.io/blog/articles/artificial-intelligence/working-against-powershell-a-collaboration-story-between-ai-and-cti-teams/" target="_blank">an article</a> about the collaboration between the CTI and AI team on the subject of PowerShell scripts.
