Harfanglab is a cybersecurity scale-up that develops an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software to detect and neutralize modern cyberattacks on corporate desktops and servers. The software detects abnormal behavior and generate security alerts or block the execution of programs. Harfanglab's ambition is to protect companies and state administrations against modern IT threats (cybercrime, data theft, influence) that endanger the economic health of companies and the security of the Nation.

My work at HarfangLab was to design, develop and deploy deep and machine learning models using Python. If you're fluent in french and want to know more about my job, you can check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pfDp5nk5kg" target="_blank">the interview</a> that I've done for Welcome To The Jungle.

HarfangLab have a blog where my team wrote articles about AI in the cybersecurity world. In this blog I wrote <a href="https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/owershell-collaboration-ia-cti/" target="_blank">an article</a> about the collaboration between the CTI and AI team on the subject of PowerShell scripts. I also wrote <a href="https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/generating-attacks-at-scale-without-a-real-computer-park/" target="_blank">another article</a> about the creation of a virtual IT infrastructure to generate malicious data.
